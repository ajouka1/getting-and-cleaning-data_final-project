    The R script run.analysis.R does the following:
      *Dowload and unzip the file
      *read the activity and feature info
      *read both the trainging and test datasets and keep only measurements on mean or standard deviation.
      *read the subejct and activity data
      *bind everything column wise together 
      *merge the two dataset of traing and test into one data set
      *first convert activity and subejct to factos, then make them ID variables
      *creates a tidy, tall dataset that consists of the mean value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
      *the end result is shown in the file tidy.txt
